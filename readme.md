# Background
A Gyrocopic Hand rehabilitation device was designed and has been detailed in Master's Thesis: DESIGN OF A PORTABLE AND COMPACT GYROSCOPIC DEVICE FOR HAND REHABILITATION, Namita Anil Kumar, Texas A&M University, 2017. 
Given the gyroscopic torque generated by the device, these scripts evaluate the distributed forces acting on various points of the user's hand. The equations are based on grasping models detailed in R. M. Murray, Z. Li, and S. S. Sastry, A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation, vol. 29. CRC Press, 1994.
